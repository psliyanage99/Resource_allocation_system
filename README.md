<h1> Resource_allocation_system</h1>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This system is an online resource allocation system project. It includes all
the features and functions needed to efficiently reserve and manage
resources in our university such as labs, auditorium, playground, etc. It
includes an administrator account which is used to handle/control all the
system functionality. It has a user management module for managing
the user and assigning the right responsibilities for operating system
functionality. The system keeps track of resource status and usage of
resources. The users will be able to see the status (whether the resource
has been reserved or vacant) of said resources. And when he or she is
booking, he or she can see the status of that resource status in the
calendar in realtime. The system keeps records of reservations along
with associated lecture details. The administrator can easily check the
hall reservations and timings in the system GUI and generate some
reports.</p>
